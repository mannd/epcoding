## Description
EP Coding is an [Android](http://www.android.com) application
that is intended to help practicing cardiac electrophysiologists
document their procedures and other billable activities by selecting
proper CPT® codes, based on the latest billing guidelines.  The app is
not for professional coders, and does not take into account the coding
modifiers and different billing specifications of various billing
agencies.  It is useful for those physicians who need to enter billing
codes directly into EHR systems, such as EPIC, or who just need to
communicate to the coders what they have done.  Of course all codes
billed must be documented in procedure notes.  The rules for entering
codes are complex, and the codes themselves are not mnemonic, hence
this app.  This app currently uses the 2013 codes, but will be updated
as coding changes.  We are not liable for any errors in coding that
might occur from using this app, please see the licensing information below.

The ultimate source is the CPT® 2013 and 2014 Professional Editions, available
from the
[American Medical Association](http://http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/cpt/cpt-featured-products.page?).
The AMA stipulates a license fee for use of their codes.  The CPT®
codes used in this program are only a small subset of the thousands of
codes available, and full descriptions of the codes are not included.
The data for this program was drawn from other readily available free
sources, including the
[Boston Scientific 2013 Billing and Coding Guide](http://http://www.bostonscientific.com/cardiac-rhythm-resources/assets/downloads/reimbursement/2013/CRM-129704-AA-2013-Billing-CodingGuide.pdf),
and articles such as
[this one](http://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Changes-Coming-2013-CPT-Codes).
For these reasons, it is felt that the use of the small subset of
codes applicable to EP is covered under the
[Fair Use Doctrine](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) of
the Copyright Act and not subjected to the licensing fees imposed by
the AMA.
