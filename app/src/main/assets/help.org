* EP Coding Help
** EP Coding 101
Don't want to read the manual?  Here's the TL;DR:
- Choose a procedure.
- Select codes from the list of codes presented.
- Tap the *Sedation* button to calculate sedation coding for the procedure.
- Tap *Summarize* to see a summary of selected codes along with warnings or errors in coding.
- Select [[ICD10][ICD-10 diagnostic codes]].
But there's a lot more to *EP Coding*.  Read on if you dare...
** Why EP Coding?
Current Procedural Terminology a.k.a. CPT® coding is not for the faint
of heart.  This is especially true for electrophysiologists, whose
procedures can be as difficult to code as they are to perform (well,
almost).

CPT coding is arcane.  Unlike other medical coding systems, it is a
proprietary system, copyrighted and owned by the American Medical
Association (AMA).  It is a secretive system unless you are willing to
shell out large quantities of money to buy the [[https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store/][official AMA coding book]]
or attend a CPT coding seminar.  To make matters worse, the AMA tweaks
the system on a yearly basis, so that to keep up it is necessary to
buy their book or attend a seminar yearly.  But this is overkill for
the average physician, who basically just wants to know how to code
for procedures he or she commonly performs and enter these codes in
the Electronic Health Record.

There is a strong temptation to throw up one's hands in despair and
just let the professional coders code procedures based on whatever is
documented in the procedure report.  But wait!  You can do this!  You
have *EP Coding* on your mobile device.  It only cost you 99¢ and
future updates are free.  And it is tailored to you, the practicing
electrophysiologist.
** Who should use EP Coding?
Physicians who perform cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures and
are required to submit CPT codes for these procedures. *EP Coding* is
intended to help EP physicians enter the correct codes in an EHR
(Electronic Health Record).  It is not intended for professional
coders nor is it a substitute for the [[https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store/][AMA official CPT documentation]].
** How does EP Coding help?
- List relevant CPT codes for EP procedures, with succinct descriptions.
- Determine which codes can and cannot be combined for specific procedures.
- Analyze selected codes for errors and warnings.
- Add code modifiers as needed.
- Calculate sedation codes for procedures.
- Read [[General hints][help on how to code procedures]].
** How to use EP Coding
*** Select a procedure
#+CAPTION: Procedure list
[[./procedure_list_phone.png]]

On an Android phone, the initial screen when the app starts shows a
list of common EP procedures.  On an Android tablet, the list of
procedures appears at the side of the screen.

#+CAPTION: Procedure list an Android tablet
[[./procedure_list_tablet.png]]

The procedure list covers most common EP procedures.  If a procedure
is not listed, you have several options.  You can use the
[[Wizard][*Device Wizard*]] to code complicated device procedures.
You can [[Search][*Search*]] for specific codes.  You can also use the
*All EP Codes* option of the procedure list, which contains all
EP-related codes in numeric order.
*** Procedure codes
**** Types of codes
Each procedure has a list of codes
#+CAPTION: Atrial fibrillation ablation codes.
#+NAME: code list
[[./afb_codes.png]]

Codes are organized as /primary codes/, at least one of which needs to
be selected, and /additional codes/ which are commonly used with the
primary procedure codes.  There is a checkbox to the right of each
code to indicate which codes are selected.  Codes that must be
selected for a particular procedure are automatically selected
(indicated by a checkmark) and cannot be unselected (indicated by a
lighter gray text color).  Prohibited codes that cannot be selected
because they are bundled with the primary code(s) are also shown in a
lighter gray text color, indicating these codes are disabled.
**** Selecting codes
#+CAPTION: Selecting a code.  The 3D mapping code has been selected.
[[./afb_selected_code.png]]

Select a code by tapping it.  Unselect the code by tapping it again.
Hitting the back button and going back to the main procedure list will
unselect any selected codes (though selected codes can be saved -- see
[[Save][saving codes]].
**** Clear selected codes
Tap *Clear* to clear the selected codes.
**** Code modifiers
The CPT coding system includes hundreds of code /modifiers/ that can
or must be added to codes, depending on circumstances.  It is beyond
the scope of this help text to explain the intricacies of modifiers.
*EP Coding* includes the most common modifiers, and by default these
modifiers are applied to codes when appropriate.  Modifiers can be
added or edited for each code, saved to become new defaults, or reset
to the original program defaults.  Saving modifiers is especially
useful if your expert coders suggest using other modifiers than the
program's defaults, or if the AMA decides to change which modifiers
are appropriate.  For example, some codes contain both a physician and
facility component, while others contain only a physician component.
The former type of code needs to have modifier 26 attached, whereas
the latter doesn't.  Go figure.

#+CAPTION: Modifier screen with Modifier 26 selected.
[[./modifiers.png]]

Long press on a code (for a second or two) to bring up a list of
common code modifiers that can be added or removed from each code.
Select or unselect a modifier by tapping on it.  Tap the *Add* button
to add the modifier (or subtract it) from the code and return to the
code list.  Tap the *Save* button to make this modifier a default so
that it is attached to the code all the time.  Tap *Reset* to reset
saved modifiers back to their default values.  Note that pre-selected
primary codes and prohibited codes can't be modified in the specific
procedure modules.  However any code can be modified using the All
Codes module.
**** Sedation coding
As of 2017, the AMA, in their never ending quest to make life
complicated for physicians, decided to unbundle sedation coding from
procedures codes.  Six new sedation codes were added, dependent on the
age of the patient and whether the physician performing the procedure
was also performing (i.e. supervising) the administration of moderate
sedation.  Codes are separated between codes for the initial 15
minutes of sedation, and subsequent 15 minute intervals.  The latter
codes can be applied multiple times, depending on the duration of
sedation.  To complicate matters further, there are rules for rounding
time periods, so that, for example, the initial 15 minutes of sedation
code can only be applied for time periods between 10 and 22 minutes.
If you administer 9 minutes of sedation, no sedation codes can be
submitted.  Also note that sedation time does not equal procedure
time.  It must be tracked and documented separately.

Given all this, *EP Coding* now has a sedation calculator
#+CAPTION: Sedation coding calculator
[[./sedation_time.png]]

From the procedure code list screen (see [[code list][figure]]) tap
*Sedation* at the bottom of the screen to add sedation codes.  You may
need to scroll the screen down to see the set of buttons which are at
the end of the list of procedure codes.  When you tap the button a
menu appears offering to *Add* sedation codes.  (Note that after
adding sedation codes, this button appears as *Edit*).  Selecting
*Add* then brings up a screen similar to the one above.  Enter the
sedation time (not procedure time), rounded down to the nearest
minute.  Select whether the same MD (i.e. you) performed the procedure
and administered sedation (administering doesn't mean you did it
personally, just that you were the one supervising whoever gave the
sedation).  If another physician, e.g. an anesthesiologist,
administered the sedation, the calculator will determine the proper
coding, but that other MD is the one who must submit the codes.  The
other factor that you must choose is the age of the patient: greater
or less than 5 years old.

To assist with determining the sedation time, tap *Calculate* to the
right of the sedation time label.  The next screen will appear.

#+CAPTION: Sedation time calculator
[[./sedation_time_calculator.png]]

Set the time selector (which is a 24 hour clock) to the start of
sedation time, then tap *Set*.  Tap the button on the top of the
screen to change to End Time.  Set the end time on the time selector
and then tap the *Set* button again.  Tap *Calculate* to transfer the
calculated time in minutes to the Sedation time text entry field.
Note that if the end time is earlier than the start time, the
calculator assumes that the procedure went past midnight (too bad!),
and calculates accordingly.

Tap *Add Sedation* to add the sedation codes to the procedure.  A
dialog box will appear summarizing the sedation coding.  Tap *No
Sedation* if you did not use sedation during the procedure.  Tap
*Cancel* or the back button if you don't Want to add sedation coding
at this time.  When you return to the procedure detail screen, the
sedation codes won't appear on the list of codes, but they will appear
when you tap *Summarize* to get a Code Summary as described [[Code
Summary][below]].  Sedation coding using the *Device Wizard* is
handled a little differently than this, and is described further
[[Wizard][below]].
**** <<Save>>Saving codes
#+CAPTION: Toolbar icons: Search, Save, and Device Wizard icons at top right of screen
[[./icons.png]]

Tap *Save* from the top right menu (it will appear as a floppy disk
icon, see the figure) to save your selection of additional codes as a
default.  If you nearly always select the same additional codes
(e.g. always do 3D mapping with SVT ablation), save the codes and they
will preselected when you use the app again. Note that primary code
selections are not saved.
**** All EP codes module
The All EP Codes module lists every EP procedure code in numerical
order, with code number given first.  It is the /a la carte/ menu of
*EP Coding*.
*** Code Summary
#+CAPTION: Code summary
[[./summary.png]]

Tap *Summarize* to show a summary of the codes selected along with any
comments, warnings or errors.  *EP Coding* looks for codes that don't
belong together, add-on codes without primary codes, lack of sedation
coding, and other possibly erroneous coding situations.  Note that not
all incorrect combinations of codes can be detected.  When in doubt,
consult with your professional coders.
*** Searching, Device wizard, 1CD-10 codes
Tap the menu icon on the upper right of the screen for more options.
**** <<Search>>Search CPT codes
Tap *Search* to search for CPT codes by name or number.  Note that due to
the [[Abbreviations][abbreviations]] used, a search that you expect to
have results may come up empty.  For example to search for
pacer/pacemaker codes, search for "PPM."  [[Abbreviations][Here]] is a
list of abbreviations used in *EP Coding*.
**** <<Wizard>>Device wizard
Tap *Device Wizard* to steer you through complex device upgrades and
revisions.  A list of steps and possible codes is shown.  Swipe each
coding page and select the codes you need on each page.  Sedation is
added along the way.  After swiping through each page of the Wizard,
the code summary will appear when you select *Finish* or swipe past
the last page.
**** <<ICD10>>ICD-10 codes
 *EP Coding* includes a searchable list of ICD-10 codes.  ICD-10 codes are provided by CMS.gov, and are updated on October 1 of each year.  Previous versions of the app only included a subset of the codes relating to cardiology, but now we include all the diagnostic codes.  The codes are the so-called ICD-10-CM codes, which are the diagnostic codes (the ICD-10-PCS procedure codes are not included, as these are more relevant to facility coding).  Use the search bar to narrow down and find the right code.  For example, here is a search for "fib":

#+CAPTION: ICD-10 search for "fib.
[[./icd_10_codes.png]]

Note that all ICD-10 codes start with a /letter/ not a /number/.  Thus for example the code for /Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is *I48.0*, /not/ *148.0*.
**** Help
Well, you're reading this, so you must have figured out already that
you select *Help* to get help.
** General hints
- Set code analysis to verbose.
- Use the specific procedure modules rather than the All EP Codes
  module for coding procedures.
- Don't use the raw sedation codes in the All EP Codes module for sedation coding.  Use the *Sedation* button instead.
- You may find it easier to use the [[Wizard][*Device Wizard*]] to do device
  upgrade coding rather than the Upgrade/Revision/Extraction module.
- Use the All EP Codes module if you need to look up a specific code,
  as they are listed in numeric order in this module.  Alternatively,
  use [[Search][*Search*]].
- There are some rare codes in the All EP Codes module that aren't
  present in the other modules.
- Don't try to add codes that are disabled in a procedure module.
- If you nearly always add codes to a procedure (e.g. 3D mapping with
  AFB ablation), then save it as a default using the [[Save][*Save*]] icon.
- *Warnings* (indicated by *!* or an emoticon, depending on the capabilities of your device, and [[Settings][*Settings*]]) point out codes that you may be
  missing or code combinations that possibly shouldn't be used
  together.
- *Errors* (indicated by *!!* or an emoticon) indicate code
  combinations that almost certainly are not allowed.
- Check with your coders or the [[https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store/][AMA documentation]] if you are not sure
  how to code a procedure.
** Specific procedures
*** AFB ablation
- Includes comprehensive EP testing, LA pacing and recording and
  transseptal puncture.
- Add 93657 if additional AFB ablation done beyond pulmonary vein
  isolation.
- Add 93655 if separate supraventricular arrhythmia mechanism
  ablated (e.g. focal atrial tachycardia).
*** SVT ablation
- Includes comprehensive EP testing.
- SVT ablation code is used for any kind of SVT ablation including
  WPW, focal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and AV nodal reentry.
*** VT ablation
- Includes comprehensive EP testing, LV pacing and recording, and
  mapping codes.
- You can't add mapping codes 93609 or 93613 to VT ablation!
*** AV node ablation
- It is not clear if EP testing codes can be combined with AV
  node ablation.
- It is not clear if mapping codes can be combined with AV node ablation.
- These points may need to be clarified with your coders.
*** EP testing
- Use 93620 (EP testing with attempted arrhythmia
  induction).
- Don't code with ablation procedures (? exception AV node
  ablation).
- You can add mapping codes, but don't add ablation codes to EP
  testing.
- Make sure you have performed and documented all components for code 93620:
  - insertion of multiple catheters
  - right atrial pacing and recording
  - right ventricular pacing and recording
  - His bundle recording
  - Induction or attempted induction of arrhythmia
- If there is no attempted induction of arrhythmia (e.g. arrhythmia is incessant and already present), use code 93619.
- If not all components can be performed (e.g. patient in atrial fibrillation so no atrial pacing), it may be necessary to use individual component codes rather than the comprehensive EP codes.  These codes are found in the all Codes module and may be combined as needed:
  - 93600 Bundle of His recording
  - 93602 Intra-atrial recording
  - 93603 Right ventricular recording
  - 93610 Intra-atrial pacing
  - 93612 Intraventricular pacing
  - 93618 Induction of arrhythmia
- If left atrial pacing and recording is performed, add code +93621 to one of the primary EP study codes.  If there is only left atrial recording but not pacing (e.g. patient in atrial fibrillation), or vice-versa, add modifier 52 (reduced services).
*** New PPM or ICD
- Use codes 33206 to 33208 for new PPM depending on number of leads.
- Use 33249 for new single or dual ICD.
- Add code 33225 to dual chamber device code for PPM or ICD with CRT.
- Add 93641 if you do DFT testing during the ICD implant.
- Placing a sub-cutaneous array is probably best coded with 33999
  (unlisted surgical procedure code).
- <<Q0>>Modifier Q0 must be used for primary prevention ICDs (the majority of implants in most cases).  Modifier Q0 must be removed for other ICD indications (i.e. secondary prevention).
*** Replace PPM or ICD
- Use 33227 to 33229 for PPM replacement and 33262 to 33264 for ICD
  replacement depending on number of leads.
- Do not add generator removal codes to these codes!
- Add 93641 if you do DFT testing during ICD generator replacement.
- Remember to use [[Q0][Modifier Q0]] if needed.
*** Upgrade/revision/extraction
- This is the most complicated coding area. We will break this
  down into some specific situations.  You can also use the [[Wizard][*Device
  Wizard*]] to lead you through this.  This is the simplest way to do
  this!
- Note codes are arranged in logical groups, not necessarily in
  numeric order.
- Don't forget [[Q0][Modifier Q0]]!
**** Lead addition only, no change in generator
- Use specific lead placement code, e.g. 33216, place A lead.
- Use 33224 to place an LV lead if the CRT generator is already there.
**** Lead repositioning
- Reposition previously implanted single A or V lead: 33215
- Reposition previously implanted LV lead: 33226
**** Removal of generator alone
- PPM generator removal: 33233
- ICD generator removal: 33241
- Don't use these codes in conjunction with generator-only
  replacement codes, but do use them with new/replacement system codes
  for upgrades (see [[Upgrade of system]]).
**** Removal/extraction of leads
- PPM single lead extraction: 33234
- PPM dual lead extraction: 33235
- ICD 1 or 2 leads extracted: 33244
- LV lead extraction has no specific code, probably should use
  33234 or 33999 (unlisted procedure).
**** Removal of entire system without replacement
- Use combination of generator removal and lead removal codes as
  appropriate.
**** New/replacement device
- PPM:
  - 33206 new/replacement PPM with new A lead
  - 33207 new/replacement PPM with new V lead
  - 33208 new/replacement PPM with new A and V leads
- ICD: 33249 new ICD, single or dual, with leads
- Plus LV lead: +33225
**** Upgrade of system
- Single chamber to dual chamber PPM (includes new lead, removal
  of old generator and placement of new generator) : 33214
- Other situations: code removal of generator and removal of
  leads if leads are removed, then code for insertion of new system.
- Example: upgrade of single chamber PPM to ICD with CRT.
  - Code PPM generator removal: 33233
  - Code single or dual ICD system implant: 33249
  - Code implant LV lead with new system: +33225
**** Place generator, existing leads
- Single chamber PPM generator: 33212
- Dual chamber PPM generator: 33213
- Single chamber ICD generator: 33240
- Dual chamber ICD generator: 33230
- CRT ICD generator: 33231
**** Pocket revision
- PPM pocket revision: 33222
- ICD pocket revision: 33223
**** Lead repair
- One lead repaired: 33218
- Two leads repaired: 33220
*** Other procedures
- These are miscellaneous EP procedures (tilt table, cardioversion,
  etc.)
- Fluoroscopy to check for lead integrity: 76000
*** All EP codes
- Lists all codes in the app in /numeric/ order.
- Avoid using this module unless other ones don't cover coding
  because procedure is unusual or rarely done.
- Code analysis may not check every combination of codes selected
  in this module.
- This module can be useful to look up specific code numbers.
- Sedation codes are listed, but it is preferable as in the other modules to use the sedation calculator to compute sedation codes.
** <<Settings>>Settings
